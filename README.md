## Flutter Dropdowns Mock

* Flutter application to showcase 2 Dropdowns, Countries and States of that specific selected country.
* Clicking on Submit button will validate the form.
* IF selections are valid you'll be presented with new screen **Profile Page**.
* You can reselect the country & state.
* Proper Error & Exception Handling with Internet checker.

## Packages Overview

* Folder Structure - inspired from CLEAN but Custom.
* State Management ```flutter_bloc``` - Cubit 
* ```Dartz``` - Functional Programming to return Type Either<Left, Right>
* ```animate_do``` - Basic Premade animation library with inbuilt widgets for any animations
* ```equatable```: Object & State Equality
* ```internet_connection_checker``` - to check device's internet connection
* ```mocktail```- Generate Mocks for testing
* ```dio```- network Client to do API calls
* ```flutter_dotenv```- Makes ```.env``` available in flutter project.




## Architecture Overview

Application Currently uses a basic structure of CLEAN architecture and Good Code Practice. Most Importantly all the Layers are Separated hence any layer can be replaced with any DI object. 

* lib: Application Specific base folder
* core: All common application-specific configurations
  * error: common failure classes used in dartz "Either" to return errors
  * network: network client configurations & Interceptor
    * required ```.env``` file with variable ```API_KEY```
  * shared: shared widgets, painters
  * utils: application utility classes like colors, constants
  * injector : dependency injector global declaration with GetIt
* features
  * home
    * data layer
      * datasources: RemoteDatasource used to call APIs to get all countries and all States
      * models: Place model basic common blueprint to fetch data
      * repositories: The abstract middleware repository's implementation for calling remote data source methods includes an internet checker to check network connection and call API methods.
    * domain layer
      * repositories: Abstract Middleware repository to segregate domain with data layer and call the Implementation Class using singleton object in DI.
    * presentation layer
      * cubit: HomeCubit to manage states
      * pages: HomePage & ProfilePage with actual widgets use case
      * widgets: Contains CommonDropDown Widget used in HomePage



## .ENV

>Create ```.env``` in ```lib/core/network``` to run the code

```
API_KEY="value"
```
